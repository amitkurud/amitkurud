<h1 align="center"> Hello there !!! My name is Amit Kurud ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

ðŸš€ Full-Stack Developer | Java Ecosystem Enthusiast | Tech Explorer

I thrive at the intersection of creativity and code, with 5+ years of experience crafting scalable solutions across the stack. My playground? Java and its vibrant ecosystemâ€”where I architect microservices using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and JPA, and wrangle event-driven systems with Kafka. But I donâ€™t stop thereâ€”Iâ€™m fluent in Kotlin, TypeScript, and JavaScript, and I love diving into modern frameworks like NestJS and ReactJS or tinkering with Android development.

Tech curiosity is my fuel ðŸ”¥â€”if thereâ€™s a language, tool, or paradigm that sparks innovation (Rust? Go? You name it!), Iâ€™ll eagerly experiment with it.

ðŸ’¡ Open Source Advocate: Iâ€™m passionate about collaborative innovation. Whether itâ€™s contributing to meaningful projects, debugging thorny issues, or building tools that empower developers, Iâ€™m all in. Got an OSS project that needs a hand? Letâ€™s talk!

ðŸŽ“ Background: Holding a Bachelor of Engineering degree, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in fast-paced environments, balancing clean architecture with pragmatic problem-solving. Always learning, always shipping.

Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re building something cool, need a versatile developer who geeks out on tech, or just want to debate microservices vs. monoliths over coffee! â˜•
